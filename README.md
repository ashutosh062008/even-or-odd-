Project Overview

The program asks the user to enter a number.
It then uses a simple logic to determine if the number is divisible by 2.
If the number is divisible by 2, it is classified as even.
If the number is not divisible by 2, it is classified as odd.
The result is displayed on the screen for the user.

✨ Features

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Tools: Any Python IDE or Code Editor
📚 How It Works

The user enters a number using the input() function.

The number is converted to an integer.

The program checks number % 2 == 0.

If true, it prints that the number is Even.

Otherwise, it prints that the number is Odd.

The program ends after showing the result.

▶️ How to Run

Open your Python IDE or terminal.

Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., even_odd_checker.py).

Run the file using:

python even_odd_checker.py


Enter any number when prompted.

See if it is Even or Odd.
